RRTools Automated Workflow Notebook - Richard Dimon 01.09.23


This is a  modified version of the automated DartR scripts, incporporating RRTools analyses and differences in the final figures produced.

The main  file is called RRTools Automated Workflow Notebook_Richard Dimon 01.09.23.R
Data will be generated in an output folder for each analysis.
You can individuallly run specific analyses, or you can run the entire script which will combine all figures into a single pdf file :)

The script requires input from an RRParameters.csv file and also needs to load R files
These are called:

PSFsaved_scripts4autom
dart2splitstree.R
RRSpeciesParameters.csv
